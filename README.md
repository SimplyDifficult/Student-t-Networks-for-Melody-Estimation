# Student-t Networks for Melody Estimation

The task offered by problem of melody extraction is to obtain the frequency values corresponding to the dominant audio signal in the input monophonic or polyphonic audio data. In generalised audio signals, the sounds are highly correlated over both frequency and time domains. This complex overlap of many sounds, makes identification of predominant frequency challenging.

In advancement to this, we can deal with filtering background noise in the data, distinguish the components of audio data as voiced and non-voiced, perform instrument recognition. Some mainstream applications are query-by-humming, cover song identification, genre classification, automatic generation of karaoke accompaniment and singer characterization.
